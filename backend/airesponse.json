    "readme_content": "Scrapetube is a Python module that allows you to scrape information from YouTube without using the official YouTube API or Selenium. It provides functions to get all videos from a YouTube channel, all videos from a playlist, and search YouTube.\n\nTo use Scrapetube, you first need to install it by running the command `pip3 install scrapetube`.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use Scrapetube:\n\n1. To get all videos for a channel:\n```python\nimport scrapetube\n\nvideos = scrapetube.get_channel(\"UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g\")\n\nfor video in videos:\n    print(video['videoId'])\n```\nThis code retrieves all videos from the YouTube channel with the given channel ID (`UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g`). It then prints the `videoId` for each video.\n\n2. To get all videos for a playlist:\n```python\nimport scrapetube\n\nvideos = scrapetube.get_playlist(\"PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU\")\n\nfor video in videos:\n    print(video['videoId'])\n```\nThis code retrieves all videos from the YouTube playlist with the given playlist ID (`PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU`). It then prints the `videoId` for each video.\n\n3. To make a search:\n```python\nimport scrapetube\n\nvideos = scrapetube.get_search(\"python\")\n\nfor video in videos:\n    print(video['videoId'])\n```\nThis code performs a search for the keyword \"python\" on YouTube. It retrieves the videos related to the search query and prints the `videoId` for each video.\n\nFor more detailed information and additional options, you can refer to the [Scrapetube documentation](https://scrapetube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)."
